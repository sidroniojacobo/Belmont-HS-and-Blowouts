                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">When the blowouts erupted in 1968, Sal Castro, a teacher at Lincoln High School, emerged as a key figure and spokesperson for the movement. However, Sal Castro’s commitment as a student advocate can be traced back to 1963, at Belmont High School, where he first started his career as a social science teacher (Castro, undated; Garcia &amp; Castro, 2011, pg. 95).&nbsp;</h3>

Given that he taught U.S. history, world history, and government, Sal Castro’s found it necessary to develop students’ critical thinking, civic engagement, and self-advocacy. Castro believed if students could critique their education and organize, they could assert their influence at school and their communities for more equitable educational opportunities (pg. 98). One way he drove this message was making students question that despite 60% of students were of “Mexican/Latinx” descent, there was no representation of Mexican American students in college preparatory courses or student government (Salazar, 1964). As Castro talked to more Mexican/Latinx students about such issues, a group of “Mexican/Latino” students were motivated to run for student government to ensure that challenge the fact that the student government was entirely white or Asian. As Sal Castro recalls students <em>were</em> so eager to run that these students created a collective electoral party. These students elected the banner name of “The Tortilla Movement” in reference to the fact that “tortillas” could quickly signal to other Mexican/Latino students that TM sought to represent them (Garcia &amp; Castro 2011, pg, 99).&nbsp;</strong></p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-4 col-md-12"><p><strong>Indeed, the Tortilla Movement’s efforts were not greeted with support across the entire campus community of students, teachers, and staff. Tension and opposition grew for the TM group when two TM candidates took Mr. Castro’s advice and spoke in Spanish during a lunch assembly in efforts of appealing to the “400 to 600 kids” who were “limited English-speaking, Foreign students” (Garcia &amp; Castro, 2011, pg. 100; Salazar, 1964). As these students gave their speeches in Spanish, administrators immediately cancelled the assembly citing students had violated school policies. Despite this matter, TM was successful in winning all executive positions except the president position to James Neal. Based on pictures of Yearbooks from 1963 to 1964, we can identify some of the elected candidates. In fact, the following years, there would be more Student Body Presidents who were Mexican/Latino. Indeed, the Tortilla Movement student group at Belmont High School provides one of the first accounts of collective group-identity amongst Mexican American students in the Los Angeles area before 1968 that self-advocated for the redistribution of educational resources. However, the incidents that transpired at the lunch assembly had immediate consequences for Sal Castro; first he was placed on leave and eventually was transferred to Lincoln HS, after five months at Belmont High School. (Castro; Garcia &amp; Castro, 2011).</strong></p></div>

In 1964, Ruben Salazar published an article asserting bilingualism as an “asset not liabilities” in defense of the students who were prohibited to speak Spanish at the assembly at Belmont High school all while asserting no wrong doing in the part of Sal Castro.  The newspaper article further outlined a “list of recommendations to redress the inferior conditions hampering Mexican American achievement” at Belmont High School (Petrzela, 2015; Salazar, 1964). Such event highlights how Sal Castro became a public figure as an advocate for Mexican American students.&nbsp;</strong></p>

In order to push back against the narrative, opponents of Sal Castro also began publishing op-ed pieces too.

Additionally, Mrs. Vivian Lefont, a Belmont teacher for over 14 years, also questioned the authenticity of Sal Castro’s words (Neal, 1964).

                                   By exploring the events relating to students’ ability to speak Spanish during lunch assemblies and subsequent coverage by the LA times, another key figure who also spent time at Belmont High School is identified: Ralph Poblano. Sal Castro’s firing gained coverage through the help of Ralph Poblano, a former Belmont HS teacher, who at the time of the incident was a member of the Mexican American Ad Hoc Committee. Through Ralph’s support, Sal Castro took his case to Ruben Salazar, one of the few Mexican-American journalist at the Los Angeles Times newspaper headquarters at the time (Garcia &amp; Castro, 2011). Before the community was able to successfully elect “Latino activist and Harvard Ph.D.” Julian Nava, the first Mexican-American to serve in the LAUSD Board of Education, Ralph Poblano had been a preferred community candidate (Petrzela, 2015, pg. 42). Despite the fact Ralph Poblano and Sal Castro taught at Belmont High School, it if often not fully discussed. For example, the book, “Classroom Wars: Language, Sex and the Making of Modern Political Culture”, references Ralph Poblano, however, there is not a single reference Belmont High School. This could be because it is reference Dolores Delgado Bernal’s dissertation, which only mentions Belmont HS once (Delgado Bernal, Solorzano, &amp; Wells, 1997). Interestingly, Delgado’s dissertation notes that Belmont High School was 60% Latino in 1968 and not 1963 as Sal Castro recalls. (Delgado, 1998).  In conclusion, through this example, we learned that Belmont High School, by 1968, has been recognized as a immigrant-serving high school with histories of student activism through student government.
